# Utility

This repository is a collection of scripts that have been created for various miscellaneous reasons and purposes, from actual usage to simply wanting to figure out how to do something and writing a little script to do so.

Ema1l: This Bash Script is used in order to send an email from the computer to an email address from the command line, and can include a message and subject to a specified email address. The email, however, will usually go to spam for it is highly suspicious looking.

Flip Screen: This Bash Script is used in order to flip the screen of the computer by 90 degrees.

PingScanner: This Bash Script is able to determine which IP addresses are responsive and only return the IPs of the responsive ones.

TextMessageWay1: This was a Bash script way that was able to send a text message from the command line to a specified phone number by using www.textbelt.com and sending the text message through that. NOTE: THIS NO LONGER WORKS DUE TO ADDED REGESTRATION CODE NEEDED

TextMessageWay2: This is a Bash script that is able to send a text message from the command line using Postfix. NOTE: SCRIPT IS NOT FINISHED YET/MAY REQUIRE POSTFIX CONFIGURATION CHANGES.

TouchPadSensitivity: This is a Bash script that lowers the sensetivity of the track pad by a decent amount. I use this often on my Linux partition since before I used this script to desensitize the pad the mouse would constantly move and click while I was typing.

Txtmsg: Simply a symlink to the currently usable way to send text messages, currently set to TextMessageWay2.

offBluetooth: simply a command to turn off bluetooth that will have a symlink to be run on startup.

updateContainers: A Bash script to update all lxc vms that I currently have. NOTE: I DID NOT PERSONALLY WRITE THE LOGIC OF THIS SCRIPT.
